bytrack.py - is an attempt to measure velocity and acceleration of moving objects detected but it does not work and will not work before we figure our skewing
heatmap.py - displays heatmap of detections in "video.mp4"
track.py - uses box annontator, trace annotator, and label annotator to annotate video

most other files are tests with the frc api and tba api for scoring data
