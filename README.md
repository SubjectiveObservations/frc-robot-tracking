python 3.11 <= is required

bytrack.py - is an attempt to measure velocity and acceleration of moving objects detected but it does not work and will not work before we figure our skewing


heatmap.py - displays heatmap of detections in "video.mp4"


track.py - uses box annontator, trace annotator, and label annotator to annotate video


most other files are tests with the frc api and tba api for scoring data (basically irrelevant tests)

results have not been added due to large file size
